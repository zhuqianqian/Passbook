PwdBook
========

Yet another Accounts and Passwords management tool.

PwdBook Features:
--------
● [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption, with 256 bits key and [PKCS#5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) standard

● [Data synchronization](#about-synchronization)

● Data import and export, even from other apps

● Password generation

● Multiple Material themes

● Free edit: add or remove any information as you wish, without a template

● In-app Search (under development, available in 2.0)

### About Synchronization

Currently the synchronization uses Google Play Games snapshot service and the integration with Google Drive is under development. It is to be available in 2.0.

### About the Name
PwdBook was originally called Passbook. After I realized many other apps also use this name, I decided to change it to PwdBook, another abbreviation form of <Password Book>. For all releases before version 2.0, the name was Passbook.
